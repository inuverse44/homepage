## 原文（稚拙な文書）
Today, I awoke at 9:00 am and ate a banana. Then, I worked out: push-ups, sit-ups, and squats, since my friends and I will be attending the basketball cup on 13th October. Around afternoon, I went to IKEA restaurant and study about the Site Reliability Engineering and the quantum information. In evening, I went to the beauty salon where I used to go. That was refreshing me.

### 推敲
Today, I woke up at 9:00 a.m. and had a banana for breakfast. After that, I worked out—push-ups, sit-ups, and squats—because my friends and I will be joining a basketball cup on October 13th. In the afternoon, I studied Site Reliability Engineering and quantum information at the IKEA restaurant. In the evening, I went to my usual beauty salon, which felt really refreshing.

### 指摘

1. “awoke” --> “woke up”
    - awokeはフォーマルすぎる
2. “ate a banana” --> “had a banana for breakfast”
    - ate a bananaでもいいけど、後者の方がスムーズで意味がクリア
3. punctuation with lists
    - push-ups, sit-ups, and squats --> better flow with commas.
    - これ、どういうこと？？
4. “since my friends and I will be attending” --> “because my friends and I will be joining”
    - *since*でもいいけど*because*の方が直接的
    - *joining a basketball cup*の方が英語としては自然
5. “Around afternoon” --> “In the afternoon”
    - 不自然。ネイティブは*In the afternoon*を使う
6. “study about the Site Reliability Engineering and the quantum information” --> “studied Site Reliability Engineering and quantum information”
    - *study about*はしばしば不必要。単純に*study \[topic\]*でよい。
7. “That was refreshing me” --> “which felt really refreshing”
    - *refreshing me*は不自然。*It was refreshing*か*It felt refreshing*を使う

## 総論
- ぱっと書くと文法がめちゃくちゃ。過去形にすらなっていない。
- SREと量子情報の内容はもっと書けるはず。
- 感情を表す言葉が稚拙。
