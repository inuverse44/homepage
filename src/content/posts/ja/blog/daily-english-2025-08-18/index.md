### 推敲
Today, I woke up at 6:00 a.m. and skipped breakfast because I didn’t have much time before going to the office. Actually, the SRE workshop was held in Miyawaka City, which is quite far from my home—it takes about 50 to 60 minutes to get there.

At 9:00 a.m., the lecture started. It was roughly divided into three parts: a lecture, a discussion, and hands-on practice. I learned how to define a service, decompose a monolithic system into microservices, apply DevOps principles, and choose appropriate storage services. It felt really exciting because I had never studied this kind of domain before.

After work, I went for a 20-minute run around the neighborhood. It was tough, but I need to build physical strength since I’ll be joining a basketball tournament two months from now.

### 指摘
1. “I didn’t have a breakfast” --> “I skipped breakfast”
   - a breakfast is wrong. We say *have breakfast* (no article). *Skipped breakfast* is the most natural.
2. “I have no much time” → “I didn’t have much time”
    - Correct structure: *don’t/didn’t have much time.*
3. “workshop for SRE is held” → “the SRE workshop was held”
   - Past tense needed (*was held*) since the event already happened.
4. “where is far away” → “which is far from my home”
    - Use *which* instead of *where is*.
5. “In 9:00 a.m. the lecture is started” → “At 9:00 a.m., the lecture started”
   - Correct preposition is *at*, and verb should be past tense.
6. “The whole lecture is consist roughly of” → “It was roughly divided into”
   - Natural way: *was divided into* not *is consist*.
7. “I learnd to define service, decompose monolicic system…” → “I learned how to define a service, decompose a monolithic system…”
    - Grammar corrections (*learned how to…, a service*, spelling *monolithic*).
8. “studied such kind of domain” → “studied this kind of domain”
   - Use *this kind of (not such kind of)*.
9. “I run 20 minites” → “I went for a 20-minute run”
   - Standard phrase: *went for a run.* Also *20-minute* (adjective form).
10 “strenght” → “strength”
    - Spelling fix.
